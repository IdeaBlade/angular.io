  With internationalization, also known as i18n, we can display our website in multiple languages. There are two different
  approaches to internationalization: with AoT compilation which requires a build step,
  or with JiT uses bindings to determine when a translation is needed.

  ### Just in time (JiT) approach
  
  The JiT approach relies on providing the translations to our application and binding them to our templates using attribute, pipes and interpolations.
  
  Its main features are:
    * Minimal server side support required:  The same version of the application code is served by the server.
    However, the server must also serve translated message bundles back to the application or have tools that embed all
    translations in the application code at build time.
    * Our application must track all the pieces of the UI that need to be updated when the locale changes.
    In addition, if the new language strings are being loaded over the network, this could take time and the UI needs to indicate this in some way to the user.
    * Allows one to support multiple languages in the same view.
    As an example, a page could display a table showing how the user's advertising message might look in different locales.
    This is fairly easy to do with this approach since it's fairly simple to have one locale per root node.

  ### Ahead of time (AoT) compilation approach
  
  The AoT approach relies on precompiling the templates using the `ngc` compiler and then injecting the translations into these files.
  
  Its main features are:
    * No information/state is (typically) lost. The user is presumably changing the language because he could not understand the earlier language.
    This means that he doesn't have unsaved information in the application.
    * Tools support: the strings to translate are easily extracted from our templates.
    The resulting translations are in a generic format that can be consumed both by Angular and one of the many translation softwares available.
    * Cannot support multiple languages in the same application view.
    * Extra server side support is needed: Since we generate different precompiled files for each language, the server must perform cookie/user agent analysis
    to decide which localized version of the application code should be returned to the user. This also causes a cache miss.

  ## Angular and i18n
  
  Whatever approach we decide to use, we must update our templates to define which strings will be translated.
 
  
a(id="i18n-attribute")
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### i18n attribute
  
  The `i18n` attribute is what tells Angular where it should insert the translations.
  It is used by both the JiT and the AoT approaches.
  
  We simply add the attribute `i18n` to an element and the content string will be replaced when necessary.
  
+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/app.component.1.html', 'i18n-attribute', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")

:marked
  To help the translators, we can add more information about the meaning and context of this string.
  Simply add a description to the i18n attribute:
  
+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/app.component.1.html', 'i18n-attribute-desc', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")

:marked
  We can add some meaning as well, separate the meaning from the description with the `|` character:
  
+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/app.component.1.html', 'i18n-attribute-meaning', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")

:marked
  While the same text with the same meaning should have the same translation, 
  the same text with different meanings can have different translations.
  Both the meaning and the description will be extracted by our messages extractor and added to the messages file.
  It will help our translators to translate our application with a better understanding of what our text means. 

  
a(id="i18n-plural-pipe")
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### i18n plural pipe
  
  When we need to pluralize some terms based on values, we can use the plural pipe.
  
  This pipe provides different translations based on a number and on a mapping (which is an object
  that mimics the [ICU format](http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/messages)):
  
+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/app.component.html', 'i18n-plural-pipe', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")
+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/app.component.ts', 'i18n-plural-pipe', 'app/app.component.ts')(format=".")

.alert.is-important
  :marked
    The ng-xi18n messages extractor doesn't support the plural pipe.

  
a(id="i18n-select-pipe")
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### i18n select pipe
  
  Just like the plural pipe displays different translations based on a number, the select pipe is used to display different
  translations based on a string that matches the current value.
  
  It also uses a mapping object that mimics the [ICU format](http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/messages):
  
+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/app.component.html', 'i18n-select-pipe', 'app/app.component.html')(format=".")
+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/app.component.ts', 'i18n-select-pipe', 'app/app.component.ts')(format=".")

.alert.is-important
  :marked
    The ng-xi18n messages extractor doesn't support the select pipe.

  ## Extract and use translations
  
a(id="ng-xi18n")
.l-main-section

  ### Extract messages with ng-xi18n
  
  Now that our templates have been updated to support i18n translations, we can use the `ng-xi18n` messages extractor.
  This cli tool is based on `ngc`, and is available in the `@angular/compiler-cli` npm package.
  
  To use it, the first thing that we have to do is to install it:
  
code-example(language="sh").
  npm install @angular/compiler-cli @angular/platform-server --save

:marked
  Like `ngc`, `ng-xi18n` is based on `tsc`, the TypeScript compiler.

  Let's make a copy of our `tsconfig.json` file called `tsconfig-aot.json` and add the `angularCompilerOptions` with `genDir` pointing to the folder where we want `ng-xi18n` to generate the file.

+makeExample('i18n/ts/tsconfig-aot.json', null, 'tsconfig-aot.json')(format=".")

:marked
  We can then use the `ng-xi18n` binary to generate a file named `messages.xlf` at the root of our application.
 
code-example(language="sh").
  ./node_modules/.bin/ng-xi18n -p tsconfig-aot.json
  
.alert.is-helpful
  :marked
    It is considered good practice to create a new npm command that will be used to run `ng-xi18n`.
    
    Edit package.json and add the following command in the `scripts` property: `"extract": "ng-xi18n"`.
    We can now generate our translations using the command `npm run extract`.

:marked
  If we want to generate this `messages.xlf` file somewhere in particular, `ng-xi18n` uses the same parameters as `ngc`.

:marked
  The generated `messages.xlf` file uses by default the format `XML Localisation Interchange File Format` (XLIFF, version 1.2).
  
  `ng-x18n` and Angular also supports the `XML Message Bundle`(XMB) format. We can switch to this format by setting
  the cli option `i18nFormat` to the value `xmb`:
   
code-example(language="sh").
  ./node_modules/.bin/ng-xi18n --i18nFormat=xmb

  ### Translate messages
  
  Now that we have generated a `messages` file, we have to make a copy by language that we want to support.
  
  If we want to support french for example, we can copy the file as `messages.fr`. We can start translating the messages,
  or send those files to our translators.
  
  You can find a list of editors supporting the xlf format [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLIFF#Editors).
  
.alert.is-helpful
  :marked
    If we choose the default `XLIFF` format, we have to add the translations into the `<target/>` elements of our `messages.xlf`
    file, such as: `<target>Bonjour i18n</target>`.
    
:marked
  Whenever we add new messages in our application, we should run `ng-xi18n` again, and copy the added translations into
  each of our localization files.
  
.alert.is-helpful
  :marked
    Using a versioning system such as `GIT` can help us find out easily what new translations have been generated by
    the messages extractor.

a(id="use-jit")
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### Use translations with the JiT approach
  
  Now that we have a localized file, we can tell Angular to use it for all of our elements that have the `i18n` marker.
  
  Angular understands `xlf`,`xlif` and `xtb` formats, but we have to provide these message into our application.
  To do that we will have to define a few providers at bootstrap time.
  
  Having the following bootstrap file:
  
+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/main.1.ts', null, 'app/main.ts')(format=".")

:marked
  We have to provide three values: `TRANSLATIONS`, `TRANSLATIONS_FORMAT` and `LOCALE_ID`:
    * `TRANSLATIONS` is a string containing the content of our `messages` file for the chosen localization.
    * `TRANSLATIONS_FORMAT` is either `xlf`, `xlif` or `xtb` depending on the format of our `messages` file.
    * `LOCALE_ID` is a string representing the locale of our chosen language.
  
  For our `messages.fr.xlf` file, we would change the bootstrap like this:  
  
+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/main.ts', null, 'app/main.ts')(format=".")

:marked
  Since TypeScript is unable to import an `xlf` file, we have to create a `.ts` file that exports the content of our
  `messages.fr.xlf` file.


+makeExample('i18n/ts/app/i18n/messages.fr.ts', null, 'app/i18n/messages.fr.ts')(format=".")

.alert.is-helpful
  :marked
    If you use Webpack you can use the [raw loader](https://github.com/webpack/raw-loader) to import your translations
    file directly like this: `const TRANSLATION = require("raw!./i18n/messages.fr.xlf");`

:marked
  That's it, our application is now internationalized! Angular will replace the content of our elements using
  the `i18n` attribute with the french translations that we provided at bootstrap.

a(id="use-aot")
.l-main-section
:marked
  ### Use translations with the AoT approach
  
  Using the AoT approach requires a little bit of setup to make the `ngc` compiler work. Refer to the
  [AoT cookbook](../cookbook/aot-compiler.html) to learn more about it.
  
  Once our project is ngc-ready, we will use `ngc` to compile a version of our application per locale. To do that
  we will add three arguments to the cli command:
    * `--i18nFile`: the path to our localization file
    * `--locale`: the name of the locale
    * `--i18nFormat`: the format of our localization file
  
  If we want to generate precompiled files for our french translations, we will use:
  
code-example(language="sh").
  ngc --i18nFile=./app/i18n/messages.fr.xlf --locale=fr --i18nFormat=xlf
  
.alert.is-helpful
  :marked
    Since you're supposed to generate precompiled file for each locale, you should probably use different `tsconfig.json`
    files with a different `genDir` for each, and different npm commands pointing to each locale.
    
    You could also write a script that directly calls the `CodeGenerator` class (exported by the package `@angular/compiler-cli`)
    for each locale.
    
:marked
  That's all that we have to do, the `ngc` compiler will replace the content of our elements using the i18n attribute
  with our translations in the AoT precompiled files.
