  This page describes the Angular documentation at a high level.
  If you're new to Angular, you may want to visit "[Learning Angular](learning-angular.html)" first.

  ## Themes

  The documentation is divided into major thematic sections, each
  a collection of pages devoted to that theme.

        Recipes for specific application challenges, mostly code snippets with a minimum of exposition.

:marked
  A few early pages are written as tutorials and are clearly marked as such.
  The rest of the pages highlight key points in code rather than explain each step necessary to build the sample.
  You can always get the full source through the #{_liveLink}s.

  ## Code samples

  Each page includes code snippets that you can reuse in your applications.
  These snippets are excerpts from a sample application that accompanies the page.

block example-links
  :marked
    Look for a link to a running version of that sample near the top of each page,
    such as this <live-example name="architecture"></live-example> from the [Architecture](architecture.html) page.

    The link launches a browser-based, code editor where you can inspect, modify, save, and download the code.

  ## Reference pages

  The [Cheat Sheet](cheatsheet.html) lists Angular syntax for common scenarios.

  The [Glossary](glossary.html) defines terms that Angular developers should know.

  The [Change Log](change-log.html) announces what's new and changed in the documentation..

  The [API Reference](../api/) is the authority on every public-facing member of the Angular libraries.
